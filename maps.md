# 1. Maps

1. The team with the higher average score in the previous round gets to pick the first map. After this, map selection alternates between teams. For the first round of a tournament, tournament officials will flip a coin and notify which team gets the first map pick.
2. No map can be selected twice in a best of three series. In a best of five, the first three maps played must all differ.

The following maps are allowed to be played:

|  | Siena | Castel Gandolfo | Venice | San Donato\* | Rome | Forli | Florence | Mont St-Michel | Pienza | Alhambra | Monteriggioni |
| :--- | :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
