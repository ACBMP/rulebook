# 1. Maps

1. The team with the higher average score in the previous round gets to pick the first map. After this, map selection alternates between teams. For the first round of a tournament, tournament officials will flip a coin and notify which team gets the first map pick.
2. No map can be selected twice in a best of three series. In a best of five, the first three maps played must all differ.

The following maps are allowed to be played:

|  | Siena | Castel Gandolfo | Venice | San Donato\* | Rome | Forli | Florence | Mont St-Michel | Pienza | Alhambra | Monteriggioni |
| :--- | :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Manhunt | Yes | Yes | Yes | BO5 | BO5 | No | No | No | No | No | No |
| Assassinate | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No | No |
| Escort | Yes | Yes | BO5 | Yes | No | BO5 | No | No | No | No | No |

* \*Only day time is allowed. San Donato Night's brightness clips quickly on TV range displays.
* BO5 Means the maps are only allowed in best of five games. However, in manhunt, these cannot be played in the final game.

## Map Rotation

#### Escort

The default map rotation for escort is:

1. Castel Gandolfo
2. Venice
3. Siena
4. Forli \(OR Rome\)
5. San Donato

## Team Selection

The first game played is played with randomized teams as ACB sets it \(i.e. no player chooses a team\).  
After the first game, the two highest scorers from the previous game go on separate teams and all other players are assigned randomly as ACB sets it.

This is only relevant for games played during an Assassins' Network season.

## Unfair Spawns

If either team spawns in one of these areas at the beginning of a match, the game has to be remade until neither team has this spawn:

1. Siena: spawning by the blue tent in escort with a VIP spawn between the green and blue areas.
