# 3. Host

As the host player always has a significantly different game experience, the game host is to be changed after every game unless all players participating in the match agree to keep playing with the same host.

#### What host controls and can affect:

* The contract system is host-dependent.
* Kills and stuns registering are host-dependent.
* Civilians are controlled by the host's system.
* Game time, rounds etc. are triggered by the host's system.

#### What host does _not_ control and _cannot_ affect:

* The connection between two players, including abilities, player locations etc.

#### How host spawn differs:

* Unlike non-host players, the host player's spawn does not depend on where the host's pursuers are. This can lead to the host spawning next to a pursuer or VIP.
* As such, the host player's spawn is only dependent on where the host died and where the host's teammates are.
