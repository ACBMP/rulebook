# 8. General Rules

1. Intentional disconnects, repeated misconduct, and repeated false accusations of misconduct are punishable by disqualification. 1. If a player or team is disqualified from a round in which they would earn a prize, their previous opponent will take their place and receive prize money on their behalf.  In the case of assassinate, the highest placing player from the disqualified player's previous series who did not advance takes their place.
2. If two players cannot connect to each other, the host must be changed until they are able to connect. If this proves unsuccessful, both players must restart their systems and try again. If at this point, a connection is still not possible, both players must install and connect to a VPN or proxy and proceed. Players who do not have access to a VPN or proxy must contact tournament officials for guidance. A lack of cooperation in this regard is ground for disqualification.
3. Players are free to insult one another, although personal attacts with racist, sexist, or otherwise hateful speech will not be tolerated.
4. "Stream sniping", i.e. viewing another player's stream or a shoutcast during a game is not allowed.
5. Team rosters cannot be changed after a tournament has begun. It is for this reason that teams are advised to has substitute players ready.
6. If a player is more than 30 minutes late to a game, a substitute must be played until the starter shows up. If a total of 1 hour since the official beginning of the game has passed and neither the starter nor the substitute has shown up, the team must forfeit the series. Alternatively, both teams can agree to reschedule the match, but the team whose full roster showed up can choose to not reschedule and claim the win.
7. If ability restrictions exist \(e.g. one firecracker per team\), players cannot swap sets with each other. This means if player A brings firecrackers and player B brings disguise, they are not allowed to despawn and have player B bring firecrackers and player A disguise in the same match. Swapping abilities between games is permitted.
8. During a series, only the teams captains of the currently playing teams are allowed to communicate with each other. Players other than the team captains attempting to communicate with players of the opposing team will be penalized by granting a free win to the opponents.
