# 7. Manhunt: Point Starving

There are multiple ways to define point starving. These are just example definitions until one single definition is agreed upon.

## Stun-based Definition

Once a player is walled up, they cannot exit the wall spot until they get at least one stun.

## Death-based Definition

If three or more players are grouped up together, none of these players can run to another spot unless their teammates they were grouped with died and only they are left alive.

## "Spots" on Manhunt Maps

So called "wall spots" or "blend spots" are loosely defined here. Each block of color represents a different blend spot, i.e. one cannot move from color A to color B if one does not fullfill the requirements according to the point starving definition.
