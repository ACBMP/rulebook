# 8. Proof of Score or Misconduct

## Score

For the score to be added up, on PC, every player in a match must take a screenshot of the final scoreboard and turn it in to tournament officials. If a player does not manage to hand in a screenshot, the lowest score shown for them by other players is used for this player's score.

## Misconduct

In the case that a team or player is accused of misconduct, video or picture proof must be sent to tournament officials. Picture proofs are only possible for map-specific glitches.

For video proof, as much of the game as possible must be shown. It is for this reason that it is advised for as many players as possible to record their gameplay during a tournament match.
