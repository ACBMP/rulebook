# 4. Glitches and Exploits

For glitches which keep a player from continuing playing a match, please view the next page.  
This page is a guideline of which glitches and exploits are allowed and which are not.

## General Gameplay

1. Stun locks are always allowed. Stun locks are when a player stuns an already stunned player before that player is able to kill them.
2. Drop stuns aka glide stuns or jump stuns are always allowed. These are when a target jumps on a pursuer and the stun gets priority over the kill.
3. Using rapid reload disguise's ability to grant a hidden bonus is always allowed.
4. Respawning to get a five kill streak on top of a three kill streak in one offense round is always allowed.
5. Stunning through chase breakers is always allowed.
6. Taking advantage of the ability for bumps to induce lag is always allowed.
7. Taking advantage of dodging a kill or stun is always allowed.

## Map Glitches

Map-specific glitches \(e.g. getting inside buildings with no doors or places where one cannot be killed\) are generally not allowed, with the following exceptions:

1. Venice docks: standing on the ledge at the edge of the water-side part of Venice is always allowed.
2. Castel Gandolfo Chandeliers: using the fact that one becomes unlockable on the chandeliers in Castel Gandolfo to one's advantage is always allowed.
3. Rome statue: jumping on the statue in Rome is allowed on the offense round in manhunt.
4. Pienza statue: jumping on the statue in Pienza is always allowed no matter the round.
5. Forli pole: having multiple people sitting on the pole in Forli is always allowed.
