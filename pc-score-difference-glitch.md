# 6. PC: Score Difference Glitch

The score difference glitch is a common glitch that only occurs on the PC platform where a player's streak may be shown twice on another player's screen.

If the score glitch occurs in a PC game, every player must take a screenshot of the scoreboard at the end. Every player's score as shown on their own screen will be used to determine who won the game.
