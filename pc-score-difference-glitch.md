# 6. PC: Score Difference Glitch

The score difference glitch is a common glitch that only occurs on the PC platform where a player's streak may be shown twice on another player's screen.

If the score glitch occurs in a PC game, every player must take a screenshot of the scoreboard at the end and send it in to the tournament officials. In assassinate, every player's individual score as shown on the majority of players' screens is used.
