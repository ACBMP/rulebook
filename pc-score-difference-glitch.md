# PC: Score Difference Glitch

The score difference glitch is a common glitch that only occurs on the PC platform where a player's streak may be shown twice on another player's screen.

If the score glitch occurs in a PC game, in a team mode, every team's individual player score is to be added up and these scores will determine which team won. In assassinate, every player's individual score shown as shown on the majority of players' screens is used.
